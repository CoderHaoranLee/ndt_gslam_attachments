Vertigo
Versatile Extensions for RobusT Inference using Graph Optimization
====================================================================

Vertigo is an extension library for g2o [1] and gtsam 2.0 [5].

It provides a C++ implementation of the switchable constraints described in
[2,3]. This extension enables g2o or gtsam to solve pose graph SLAM problems
in 2D and 3D despite a large number of false positive loop closure constraints.

In addition, a re-implementation of the max-mixture model described in [4]
is also contained.

Furthermore, Vertigo contains a number of standard pose graph SLAM datasets
and a script to spoil them with false positive loop closure constraints.
These datasets have been used in the evaluations [2] and [3]. They can serve
as a set of benchmark datasets for future developments in robust pose graph SLAM.

Have fun, I hope this is useful.
Hopefully, more stuff will be added to Vertigo in the future.
Any comments, thoughts and patches are welcome and largely appreciated.
